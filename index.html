  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accesibility:</h2>
  <h3>Web accessibility is very important because it ensures everyone has the same level of access. It is also necessary because it stops discrimination. If someone with a disability tries to access your website and it's not disability friendly, it is unfair to them and it can possibly open up a lawsuit. Another example is the colors on a website. If someone is colorblind, they will have a hard time acessing your website. It is important that the website is color blind friendly.</h3>
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement:</h2>
  <h3> Progressive enhancement is basically building something step by step and adding on with other things to make it perfect. You start off with a strong foundation, and in this case it is HTML. After you have a strong HTML code, then you can add on and enhance it with CSS and JS. It is very important in modern web development because it creates structure and makes everything more organized. It also makes it easier for another web developer to come in and edit anything if need be, because it is all seperated. HTML creates the structure, CSS styles the website, and JS increases the interactivity.<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">Progressive Enhancement</a></h3>
  <h2>Reflection on Dragon Project:</h2>
  <h3>  After collecting feedback from a few family members, they recommended that I change the theme and make it more space themed. For example, changing colors or adding more space icons. I decided to follow their advice and change the colors. Instead of having the header be light gray, I decided to change it to dark gray. That color is more space themed than light gray.</h4>
<h3> 

  If I had to start over I would plan more accordingly. I ended up freestyling a lot of things on my rough draft and I think that could have been avoided. I should have had a concise plan and followed that. The things I think I did well is choosing a font that coordinates with the theme, organized the text well, and I made it very accesible.

  <h3>This class was very enjoyable for my first semester. It helped me get a smooth transition into college because the assignments were not overwhelming and all of them came with clear instructions and assistance was offered. I loved this class and I learned a lot of valuable information that will help me in the next semester and theron. I loved this class! Thank you for everything. </h3>
